# CTEC3905 Website Assignment

# Purpose 


This website is designed for my village in India, Jogwad. The reason I am doing this is because there is no up-to-date website avaiable for Jogwadwalas to access to get information or to keep up to date with what is happening. 
The site has 4 pages: 
Home
History
Development
Gallery

I made initial drawing of these pages in paper form as I had a rough idea about what I wanted the website to look like.

About (HTML)                      | Passed
CSS                               | Errors - No time to go through them all and correct them. Did all I could
JavaScript                        | Passed - (No errors in console)

# User Testing

- I got my uncle to go through the website. Whilst he was doing this I observed him to see what his reactions were to some of the animations and if he struggled with any of the navigation across the website.

From this observation I noticed that he found it hard to read the text on the website due to the color clashing with the background. Therefore, I changed the text color.
Afterwards, I also asked him to tell me what he though about the website. He said:
The menu doesnt look good in red. 
The borders are too thick. 

Based on this I acted upon the suggestion provided and made changes according to it.
